## Description of how the code works

A class is defined as Card. Inside the class Card, code related to a playing card are entered, these include the attr accessor, def initialize and def output_card methods. 

The method attr_accessor :rank, :suit is defined first. The attr_accessor functions as a gettor and setor to allow users to get or change the values of the rank and suit.

The method def initialize(rank, suit) is defined next. The initialize method, also known as a constructor, builds up characteristics of a card. The passed arguments, rank and suit, being the attributes/characteristic of each card created. Inside the initialize method rank and suit are stored in instance variables, @rank and @suit. This allow accessibility of the variables outside the initialize method.
